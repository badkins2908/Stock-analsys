# Stocks Analysis with Excel VBA

## Overview of Project and Purpose
The project was to deepen applicable knowledge of refactoring VBA code in Excel, by looking at the runtime of the original, no-refactored code versus the refactored code. Both codes analyze the total volume and return of a full year of stock exchange data for 11 different stock tickers: AY, CSIQ, DQ, ENPH, FSLR, HASI, JKS, RUN, SEDG, SPWR, TERP, VSLR. 

This code specifically worked to hone skills in understanding indexing across arrays, nested for loops, if-then statements, as well as conditional formatting and style formatting. In addition to valuable coding skills such as refactoring code, debugging and evaluating overall code performance.

### Analysis Results
The results of the VBA code, show that 10 out of the 11 tickers had positive returns in the year 2017. With tickers DQ, ENPH, FSLR, and SEDG having an annual return of over 100%.

Where as for the year 2018, show that only 2 tickers out of the 11 had positive returns. Specifically tickers ENPH and RUN, with more than 80% annual return. Where as the remaining 9 tickers had negative annual returns.

ENPH is the only stock ticker that had a positive return for both 2017 and 2018 years.

### Non-refactored versus Refactored Performance
For the original, non-refactored code, 

## Summary
Overall, it is clear from the analysis the benefits that came from refactoring this specific stock analysis code. The refactored code reduced the run time, which can have significant impact when the raw stock data is including hundreds of tickers and their associated stock data, and not just 11 tickers.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
This project helped emphasize the importance of refactoring code -- in order to
